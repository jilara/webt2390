            <h2>How We Started</h2>
            <p class="content hidden">Billy Macs Burgers and Rings began as a dream shared between two friends, Billy Mackenzie and Mac Carson, during their college years. United by their love for classic arcade games and the quest for the perfect burger, they envisioned a place where both passions could come together. This vision was not just about creating another eatery or gaming space; it was about crafting a community hub where families and friends could gather for memorable experiences.

                In 2015, after years of planning and saving, Billy and Mac transformed an old diner in their hometown into the first Billy Macs Burgers and Rings. The restaurant was an instant hit, offering an array of gourmet burgers made from locally sourced ingredients and a variety of hand-crafted onion rings, which quickly became a town favorite. But what set Billy Macs apart was the adjoining arcade, a nostalgic nod to the golden era of gaming, blended with the latest in VR technology.
                
                Billy and Mac believed in creating a space that was as much about community as it was about food and fun. They hosted weekly gaming tournaments, family nights, and charity events, fostering a sense of belonging and togetherness. The arcade wasn't just for kids; it became a retreat for adults seeking a slice of nostalgia, a place where they could share a piece of their childhood with their own children.
                
                As word spread, Billy Macs Burgers and Rings grew from a local hangout to a regional attraction. Each new location opened with the same core values: quality food, exceptional service, and a welcoming atmosphere. The restaurants became known for their dedication to sustainability, using eco-friendly practices and giving back to the community through various initiatives.
                
                Today, Billy Macs continues to thrive, a testament to the founders' enduring friendship and their commitment to their dream. The restaurant chain remains a family-owned business, with Billy and Mac often seen greeting guests or challenging them to a game of Pac-Man. The story of Billy Macs is more than just a tale of entrepreneurship; it's a story about the power of dreams, the importance of community, and the timeless appeal of sharing good food and fun times with the people we love.</p>
